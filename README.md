# Sample Size and Power Calculations for Detecting Trends

## About this package

This tool calculates sample size and power for a range of scenarios
where counts of species have been recorded. Likelihoods considered are
bernoulli, zero-inflated biomial (rare species), Poisson, negative
Binomial and zero-inflated negative Binomial (common species).

## Installation

You can install a development version of the LRE package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/pkuhnert/AsymPower)

    # install.packages("devtools")
    remotes::install_github(repo = "pkuhnert/AsymPower", build_vignettes = TRUE, force = TRUE)

## Authors

## Methods

The equations for sample size and power are outlined in Kuhnert et
al.Â (2011). The calculations are specified in the appendix and appear in
the vignette that accompanies this package.

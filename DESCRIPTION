Description: 
    This tool calculates sample size and power for a range of scenarios 
    where counts of species have been recorded. Likelihoods considered 
    are bernoulli, zero-inflated biomial (rare species), Poisson, 
    negative Binomial and zero-inflated negative Binomial (common species).
